## 🔧 Key Challenge Response Strategies (6-Month Version)

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| **Time Pressure** | Parallel learning: learn while doing; skip non-core derivations; prioritize reproduction over invention |
| **Training Instability** | Use gradient clipping, EMA updates, KL balancing (free bits), learning rate warmup |
| **Low Data Efficiency** | Use offline pre-training + imagined space training (planning in latent space) |
| **High CARLA Latency** | Use asynchronous collection; reduce image resolution (200x88); disable non-essential sensors |
| **Resource Constraints** | Use Google Colab Pro (A100) or Lambda Labs; lightweight model design |

## ✅ Key Success Tips

1. **Set clear weekly deliverables** (e.g., Week 1: run CARLA, Week 3: train first BC model)
2. **Establish Git repository**, daily commits, record experiment logs
3. **Leverage open-source resources**:
   - [CARLA official examples](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla)
   - [DreamerV3 official implementation](https://github.com/danijar/dreamerv3)
   - [TransFuser open-source code](https://github.com/autonomousvision/transfuser) (can borrow multi-modal fusion ideas)
4. **Join communities**: Reddit r/MachineLearning, CARLA Discord, Papers With Code
